# Meal App

The “Meal App” project is designed to help users explore different types of meals by organizing them into categories. When a user opens the app, they are presented with a list of meal categories, making it easy to browse based on preference or cuisine. By clicking on a specific category, users can see a selection of meals related to that category. Each meal entry provides an option to view detailed information, including a list of ingredients and step-by-step cooking instructions. This feature aims to simplify meal planning and preparation, making it ideal for home cooks looking for inspiration and guidance in the kitchen.
