# Meal App

The “Meal App” project is designed to help users explore a variety of meals, organized into distinct categories for easy browsing. Upon launching the app, users are greeted with a list of meal categories, allowing them to explore meals based on different cuisines or preferences. By selecting a category, users can view all the meals within it, each represented by a clickable entry.

When users click on a specific meal, they are taken to a detail screen that includes a comprehensive list of ingredients and step-by-step cooking instructions to guide them through preparing the dish. Additionally, each meal detail screen includes an “Add to Favorites” button, enabling users to save meals they love for easy access later. This feature allows users to build a personalized collection of favorite meals, making meal planning more enjoyable and efficient. The “Meal App” is an excellent tool for home cooks seeking new recipes, inspiration, and organization in the kitchen.
